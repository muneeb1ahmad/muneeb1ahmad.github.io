For the course ENGR 1000 (Introduction to Enginners), Students were tasked to curate a ride, for an imaginery ammusement park. 

Our Team, Also known as Absolute Bricks created 'Brick land' and the 'Frost Fall Tower' this was a spin on Lego Land.

The attraction is based upon the 'Tower of Terror', which is a drop-ride mechanism. Our attraction 'Frostfall Tower' is built onto a baseplate which is glued on proprietary cardboard.
