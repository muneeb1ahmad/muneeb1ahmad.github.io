The attraction is based upon the 'Tower of Terror', which is a drop-ride mechanism. Our attraction 'Frostfall Tower' is built onto a baseplate which is glued on proprietary cardboard. 

Brick Land is inspired from Lego Land, this ammusement park is for all ages. The introduction of the 'Frostfall Tower' is the first in our series of collective fun for the park. 


## Sketches of Ride

The Sketch of the Mechanism contains the components to curate frost-fall tower, we sourced the motor from Lego, particularly the 4W Motor. The team has also implemented a cluth to pull the ride up, this will enable to ride to go up and down from the motor and cluth. once the cluth or level is switched on the ride would start.

Amusement Parks are not completed with fun, or animatronics. For Brick-land our team curated something unique, a presence or omage to the Holiday Tradition.

Introducing Atnas, a character who is filled with Optomism and Joy. The naming behind the character is quite humorous, the word 'Santa' spelled backwards, thus it is Atnas.
